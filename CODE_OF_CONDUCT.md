# Code of Conduct - Historical Pattern Index (HPI)

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
This project is dedicated to **data-driven historical analysis**. To maintain the integrity of the index, we enforce the following standards:

1.  **Zero Tolerance for Revisionism:** Denial or minimization of well-documented historical atrocities without extraordinary, peer-reviewed evidence is strictly prohibited.
2.  **Objective Discourse:** We discuss sources, methodologies, and data. Political activism, ideological grandstanding, and emotional appeals that lack a factual basis will be closed.
3.  **Respectful Disagreement:** Focus on the data. Attack the methodology, not the person.
4.  **No Hate Speech:** Any form of dehumanizing language directed at historical groups or project participants will result in an immediate and permanent ban.

## Enforcement
Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. 

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
