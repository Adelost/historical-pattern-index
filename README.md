# Historical Pattern Index

**We notice genocides. We overlook "market forces." This project tracks both.**

The deadliest conflict since World War II killed 5.4 million people.

It's not Iraq. Not Syria. Not Afghanistan.

It's the Second Congo War (1998-2003). Most people have never heard of it.

Why? Because it was driven by profit (coltan, diamonds, gold), not ideology. And we don't have good frameworks for seeing profit-driven mass death. We notice genocides. We overlook "market forces."

This project attempts to fix that.

## What We Found

**1. Profit kills as much as ideology.**

The highest death tolls come from profit-driven systems (slave trade, colonial extraction, resource wars), not just ideological genocides. Congo Free State killed 8-13 million for rubber. The Atlantic slave trade's death toll doesn't even count plantation deaths.

**2. <!-- STATS:DENIED_COUNT -->8<!-- /STATS:DENIED_COUNT --> events are still officially denied.**

<!-- STATS:DENIED_TABLE -->
| Event | Denier | Deaths |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Holodomor (Ukrainian Famine) | Russia | 4M-8M |
| Bangladesh Genocide (Operation Searchlight) | Pakistani Army | 300k-3M |
| Armenian Genocide | Turkey | 1M-2M |
| Greek Genocide (Pontic Greeks) | Turkey | 300k-900k |
| Assyrian Genocide (Seyfo) | Turkey | 250k-750k |
| Circassian Genocide | Russian Empire | 400k-600k |
| Dzungar Genocide | Qing Dynasty | 480k-600k |
| Darfur Genocide | Sudanese government | 200k-400k |
<!-- /STATS:DENIED_TABLE -->

**3. Speed doesn't require bureaucracy.**

Rwanda killed 70% of its Tutsi population in 100 days with machetes and radio coordination. The Holocaust took 4 years with industrial infrastructure. Ideology can mobilize faster than bureaucracy.

**4. The forgotten middle.**

Events between 1206 (Mongols) and 1492 (Columbus) are poorly documented. Medieval atrocities are underrepresented. So are inter-African and intra-Asian conflicts before European contact.

**5. The same warning signs repeat.**

<!-- STATS:PATTERNS_TABLE -->
| Warning Sign Pattern | Frequency |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Nationalist/ethnic purity ideology | 78% (39/50) |
| Economic crisis exploited | 50% (25/50) |
| Property seizures | 44% (22/50) |
| Dehumanizing rhetoric | 34% (17/50) |
| Deliberate starvation | 34% (17/50) |
| Forced displacement/deportation | 28% (14/50) |
| Militias and death squads | 20% (10/50) |
| Media incitement | 20% (10/50) |
| International inaction | 20% (10/50) |
| Colonial 'civilizing' justification | 20% (10/50) |
| Minorities scapegoated | 18% (9/50) |
| Emergency laws/state of exception | 10% (5/50) |
<!-- /STATS:PATTERNS_TABLE -->

**6. Different mechanisms, different warning signs.**

| Event Type | Dehumanizing Rhetoric |
|------------|----------------------|
| Total Erasure (ethnic cleansing) | 60% |
| Profit-Driven Attrition | 33% |

Ideological atrocities need propaganda to mobilize killers. Profit-driven atrocities need silence and distance.

## How It Works

Each event gets four scores (0-100%) based on binary checklists:

| Score | What it measures | Example high-scorer |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Systematic Intensity** | Organization, infrastructure, state involvement | Holocaust (90%) |
| **Profit** | Economic extraction as primary driver | Congo Free State (100%) |
| **Ideology** | Ethnic/religious "purification" as goal | Rwanda (100%) |
| **Complicity** | How society enabled it | Second Congo War (100%) |

Each score is calculated from a checklist of 5-10 binary questions. No subjective weighting. If 8 of 10 boxes are checked, the score is 80%.

## Limitations

This is a work in progress, not a finished truth.

- **Sample size**: <!-- STATS:EVENT_COUNT -->50<!-- /STATS:EVENT_COUNT --> events is good coverage, but gaps remain
- **Source bias**: English-language academic sources overrepresented
- **Equal weighting**: All checklist items count equally (debatable)
- **Death toll uncertainty**: Many estimates span 2-10x ranges
- **"Genocide" definition**: Some events (famines, resource wars) don't fit legal definitions but killed millions

We're not claiming this is the final word. We're claiming it's better than ignoring the pattern.
