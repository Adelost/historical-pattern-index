The deadliest conflict since World War II killed 5.4 million people.

It's not Iraq. Not Syria. Not Afghanistan.

It's the Second Congo War (1998-2003). Most people have never heard of it.

Why? Because narrative often overrides numbers. This project indexes the silent catastrophes behind the official stories and tracks the warning signs that repeat.

## What We Found

**1. Profit kills as much as ideology.**

The highest death tolls come from profit-driven systems (slave trade, colonial extraction, resource wars), not just ideological genocides. Congo Free State killed 8-13 million for rubber. The Atlantic slave trade numbers only count deaths in transit. Plantation deaths are uncounted.

**2. <!-- STATS:DENIED_COUNT -->8<!-- /STATS:DENIED_COUNT --> events are still officially denied.**

<!-- STATS:DENIED_TABLE -->
| Event | Denier | Deaths |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Holodomor (Ukrainian Famine) | Russia | 4M-8M |
| Bangladesh Genocide (Operation Searchlight) | Pakistani Army | 300k-3M |
| Armenian Genocide | Turkey | 1M-2M |
| Greek Genocide (Pontic Greeks) | Turkey | 300k-900k |
| Assyrian Genocide (Seyfo) | Turkey | 250k-750k |
| Circassian Genocide | Russian Empire | 400k-600k |
| Dzungar Genocide | Qing Dynasty | 480k-600k |
| Darfur Genocide | Sudanese government | 200k-400k |
<!-- /STATS:DENIED_TABLE -->

**3. Speed doesn't require bureaucracy.**

Rwanda killed 70% of its Tutsi population in 100 days with machetes and radio coordination. The Holocaust took 4 years with industrial infrastructure. Ideology can mobilize faster than bureaucracy.

**4. The forgotten middle.**

Events between 1206 (Mongols) and 1492 (Columbus) are poorly documented. Medieval atrocities are underrepresented. So are inter-African and intra-Asian conflicts before European contact.

**5. The same warning signs repeat.**

<!-- STATS:PATTERNS_TABLE -->
| Warning Sign Pattern | Frequency |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Nationalist/ethnic purity ideology | 75% (41/55) |
| Economic crisis exploited | 45% (25/55) |
| Property seizures | 42% (23/55) |
| Dehumanizing rhetoric | 33% (18/55) |
| Deliberate starvation | 31% (17/55) |
| Forced displacement/deportation | 25% (14/55) |
| Minorities scapegoated | 18% (10/55) |
| Militias and death squads | 18% (10/55) |
| Media incitement | 18% (10/55) |
| International inaction | 18% (10/55) |
| Colonial 'civilizing' justification | 18% (10/55) |
| Emergency laws/state of exception | 9% (5/55) |
<!-- /STATS:PATTERNS_TABLE -->

**6. Different mechanisms, different warning signs.**

| Event Type | Dehumanizing Rhetoric |
|------------|----------------------|
| Total Erasure (ethnic cleansing) | 60% |
| Profit-Driven Attrition | 33% |

Ideological atrocities need propaganda to mobilize killers. Profit-driven atrocities need silence and distance.

## Beyond the Death Toll

Some events in this index destroyed more than people. These aren't separate incidents. They're dimensions of the same atrocity.

| Event | Deaths | Also destroyed |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Native American Genocide | 1M-2M | Bison: 30M → 500 |
| Maya Conquest | 200k-500k | 5,000 codices burned. 4 survive. |
| Black War (Tasmania) | 6k-9k | 8+ languages. All extinct. |
| Mongol Sack of Baghdad | 200k-2M | House of Wisdom. 500 years of science. |
| Armenian Genocide | 1M-2M | 2,000+ churches. Language endangered. |
| Bosnian Genocide | 100k-110k | Sarajevo Library. 1.5M volumes. |

### Ecocide as Weapon

The Bison wasn't hunted to extinction. It was military strategy:

> "Let them kill, skin and sell until the buffalo is exterminated, as it is the only way to bring lasting peace."
>
> *General Philip Sheridan, US Army*

| Year | Bison population | Result |
|------|------------------|--------|
| 1800 | 30-60 million | |
| 1889 | ~500 | Plains nations forced to reservations |

When you destroy a people's food source, you don't need to kill them directly.

## How It Works

Each event gets four scores (0-100%) based on binary checklists:

| Score | What it measures | Example high-scorer |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Systematic Intensity** | Organization, infrastructure, state involvement | Holocaust (100%) |
| **Profit** | Economic extraction as primary driver | Congo Free State (100%) |
| **Ideology** | Ethnic/religious "purification" as goal | Rwanda (100%) |
| **Complicity** | How society enabled it | Second Congo War (100%) |

Each score is calculated from a checklist of 5-9 binary questions. No subjective weighting. If 8 of 9 boxes are checked, the score is 89%.

### The Hard Questions

We don't use vague criteria. Each item has a specific, falsifiable question:

| Category | Sample Question |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Ideology** | Did leaders claim *"we die if they don't"*? (Existential threat) |
| **Ideology** | Were civilians recruited to kill their neighbors? (Mass mobilization) |
| **Profit** | Would the economy collapse without this extraction? (Economic dependence) |
| **Systematic** | Did they target children to end the group's future? (Generational targeting) |
| **Complicity** | Was it called "relocation" instead of "death march"? (Euphemisms) |

Congo scores 100% Profit but 0% Ideology. Rwanda scores 100% Ideology but 0% Profit. The questions separate extraction from extermination.

## Limitations

This is a work in progress, not a finished truth.

- **Sample size**: <!-- STATS:EVENT_COUNT -->55<!-- /STATS:EVENT_COUNT --> events is good coverage, but gaps remain
- **Source bias**: English-language academic sources overrepresented
- **Equal weighting**: All checklist items count equally (debatable)
- **Death toll uncertainty**: Many estimates span 2-10x ranges
- **"Genocide" definition**: Some events (famines, resource wars) don't fit legal definitions but killed millions

We're not claiming this is the final word. We're claiming it's better than ignoring the pattern.

## Related: Lost Knowledge

Some losses are permanent. The Maya had 5,000+ codices. 4 survive. Silphium was an effective contraceptive. We destroyed it 2,000 years ago and still can't recreate it.
