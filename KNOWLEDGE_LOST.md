# Lost Knowledge Index

What humanity destroyed and can never recover.

This is not about nostalgia. It's about recognizing that some losses are permanent. Species can sometimes be reintroduced. Knowledge, once lost, is gone.

See also: [Knowledge Saved](KNOWLEDGE_SAVED.md) — what we almost lost, and how it survived.

**Data:** [`/data/knowledge_lost.json`](data/knowledge_lost.json)

---

## Criteria

Only events where:

1. **Driver matches genocide pattern** (same forces that kill people)
2. **The loss is documented** (we know something was lost)
3. **The knowledge is irrecoverable** (no copies exist, no reconstruction possible)
4. **Significant scale** (library, knowledge system, or species - not single works)

### Drivers (same as genocide patterns)

<!-- STATS:LOST_DRIVER_TABLE -->
| Driver | Count | Genocide parallel |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| religious_ideology | 4 | Religious purification genocides |
| conquest | 3 | Territorial conquest atrocities |
| ethnic_ideology | 3 | Ethnic cleansing |
| political_ideology | 1 | Ideological purges |

## What This Shows

### 1. Medical knowledge we'll never recover

**Silphium** was the most valuable plant in the ancient Mediterranean.

- **Use**: Contraceptive, abortifacient, digestive medicine, seasoning
- **Value**: Worth its weight in silver. Depicted on Cyrenean coins.
- **What happened**: Overharvested to extinction by ~100 CE
- **What we lost**: An effective contraceptive. Ancient sources are explicit: it worked.

For nearly 2,000 years after Silphium's extinction (until the 1960s), no reliable contraceptive existed. We don't know what species it was. We can't recreate it. We don't know what else it could treat.

This isn't speculation. Roman writers documented its effectiveness. We destroyed it anyway.

### 2. Scientific knowledge burned

**Library of Alexandria** held the accumulated knowledge of the ancient world.

- Estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 scrolls
- Multiple destruction events (Caesar's fire 48 BCE, Christian destruction 391 CE, Arab conquest 642 CE)
- Lost works include most of Aristotle, most Greek dramatists, scientific treatises we only know by name

**Nalanda University** was the world's first residential university. Scholars came from across Asia for 700 years.

- Destroyed by Turkic invaders in 1193
- The library reportedly burned for three months
- Buddhist philosophy, logic, mathematics, astronomy, medicine

**House of Wisdom (Baghdad)** was destroyed by Mongols in 1258.

- 500 years of Islamic Golden Age scholarship
- The Tigris reportedly ran black with ink from books thrown in the river
- Mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philosophy

**Imperial Library of Constantinople** was the last major repository of Greco-Roman knowledge.

- Survived 1,000 years after Alexandria
- Damaged by fire (473 CE), looted in Fourth Crusade (1204), final destruction in 1453
- Some scholars fled to Italy, sparking the Renaissance. Most was lost.

We reference "lost works" constantly in classical studies. Those works existed. They were destroyed.

### 3. Entire knowledge systems erased

**Maya Codices**: In 1562, Bishop Diego de Landa burned 5,000+ Maya books.

> "We found a large number of books... and as they contained nothing but superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which [the Maya] regretted to an amazing degree."

**4 codices survive.** They contain sophisticated astronomical calculations. We can only guess what the other 5,000 contained.

### 4. Languages are knowledge

When a language dies, unique knowledge dies with it.

**Tasmanian Aboriginal languages**: 8+ languages. All extinct. The last fluent speaker, Fanny Cochrane Smith, died in 1905.

These weren't just "ways of speaking." They contained:
- Names for plants and animals unknown to science
- Ecological knowledge accumulated over 35,000 years
- Oral histories we'll never hear

When the last speaker dies, the library burns.

### 5. Research erased by ideology

**Institut für Sexualwissenschaft** (Institute for Sexual Research) was founded in Berlin in 1919.

- Pioneering research on gender and sexuality by Magnus Hirschfeld
- On May 6, 1933, Nazi students stormed the institute
- On May 10, the contents were publicly burned
- The famous photographs of Nazi book burnings are mostly of this library

20,000+ books. 35,000 photographs. Patient records. Research set back decades. The patient records endangered those documented.

## The Pattern

| Destruction | Driver | Same as genocides? |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Alexandria (391 CE) | Religious ideology | Yes |
| Nalanda (1193) | Religious conquest | Yes |
| Baghdad (1258) | Conquest | Yes |
| Constantinople (1453) | Conquest | Yes |
| Maya Codices (1562) | Religious ideology | Yes |
| Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (1933) | Ideological purification | Yes |
| Sarajevo Library (1992) | Ethnic cleansing | Yes |

The same forces that kill people also kill knowledge. Often simultaneously.

## What We Don't Know We Lost

The most significant losses are the ones we can't quantify.

| Known loss | Unknown loss |
|------------|--------------|
| Maya had 4 surviving codices | What was in the other 5,000? |
| Silphium was a contraceptive | What else could it treat? |
| Alexandria had 400,000 scrolls | Which scientific breakthroughs were in them? |
| Baghdad held 500 years of science | What discoveries were lost forever? |

This is the epistemological problem: we know things were lost, but we don't know what those things were.

## Cases in Detail

### Silphium (~7th c. BCE - ~100 CE)

- **Location**: Cyrene (modern Libya)
- **Uses**: Contraceptive, digestive aid, cough medicine, seasoning
- **Value**: So valuable it was depicted on Cyrenean coins
- **Extinction**: Overharvested. Last stalk reportedly given to Emperor Nero.
- **Attempts to recreate**: All failed. We don't know the species.

The heart symbol ♥ may derive from silphium's seed shape. If true, we use a 2,000-year-old symbol of something we destroyed.

### Maya Codices (1562)

- **Location**: Maní, Yucatán
- **Perpetrator**: Bishop Diego de Landa
- **Destroyed**: 27+ codices burned, 5,000+ "idolatrous" objects
- **Surviving**: 4 codices (Dresden, Madrid, Paris, Grolier)
- **Content of survivors**: Astronomical tables, calendrics, divination

The survivors show sophisticated mathematics. The Dresden Codex contains Venus tables accurate to within 2 hours over 500 years. What astronomical knowledge was in the 5,000 that burned?

### Tasmanian Languages (extinct by 1905)

- **Languages**: 8+ distinct languages
- **Speakers at contact (1803)**: ~5,000-10,000
- **Last fluent speaker**: Fanny Cochrane Smith (died 1905)
- **Recordings**: Wax cylinder recordings exist (limited)
- **Reconstruction**: Attempted, but full fluency impossible

Complete language family extinction. The linguistic equivalent of total species erasure.

### Sarajevo Library (1992)

- **Location**: Sarajevo, Bosnia
- **Perpetrator**: Serbian nationalist forces
- **Destroyed**: 1.5 million volumes, 155,000 rare books
- **Method**: Incendiary shells, August 25-26, 1992
- **Content**: Unique records of Bosnian Muslim, Croat, and Serb coexistence

The library was deliberately targeted. Firefighters who tried to save it were shot at by snipers. The destruction of shared history was part of ethnic cleansing.

### Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (1933)

- **Location**: Berlin, Germany
- **Founder**: Magnus Hirschfeld (1919)
- **Destroyed**: May 6-10, 1933
- **Content**: 20,000+ books, 35,000 photographs, patient records
- **Method**: Nazi students stormed institute, public book burning

The famous images of Nazi book burnings are mostly of this library. Hirschfeld was Jewish and gay. The institute advocated for gay rights and pioneered transgender medicine. Patient records were destroyed, endangering those documented. Research on gender and sexuality was set back decades.

## Connection to Main Index

Many knowledge destruction events connect to genocides in the main index:

<!-- STATS:LOST_CONNECTION_TABLE -->
| Knowledge lost | Connected genocide |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Library of Carthage | Destruction of Carthage |
| House of Wisdom | Mongol Sack of Baghdad |
| Aztec Codices | Colonization of the Americas |
| Maya Codices | Spanish Conquest of Yucatán |
| Tasmanian Languages | Black War (Tasmania) |
| Institut für Sexualwissenschaft | The Holocaust |
| Yiddish Libraries | The Holocaust |
| Sarajevo Library | Bosnian Genocide |
<!-- /STATS:LOST_CONNECTION_TABLE -->

Genocide kills people. Epistemicide kills their knowledge. Often the same perpetrators do both.

## Limitations

1. **Quantification is difficult**: "400,000 scrolls" is an estimate
2. **We can't know what we lost**: By definition, lost knowledge is unknown
3. **Attribution is complex**: Some losses have multiple causes over centuries
4. **Western bias**: Better documentation of European/Mediterranean losses
