  "description": "The devastating 1864-1870 war in which Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay fought Paraguay. Paraguay lost 60-90% of its population, including most adult males. The victors imposed harsh terms and territorial losses. One of the deadliest conflicts in modern history by proportion of population killed.",

A forgotten war: most people outside South America have never heard of it, despite death toll rivaling major 20th century conflicts.
