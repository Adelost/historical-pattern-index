Tang Dynasty census shows 36 million population drop - even accounting for refugees and census failures, mortality was catastrophic. An Lushan was a Sogdian-Turkic general who exploited Tang military structure. After his assassination, war continued under successors. Tang never recovered its golden age power. Shows how military-political fragmentation can kill more than ideological genocides. Largely unknown in West despite scale exceeding most European conflicts combined.",
